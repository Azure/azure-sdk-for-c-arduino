## Introduction

This is a "to-the-point" guide outlining how to run an Azure SDK for Embedded C IoT Hub telemetry sample on an ESP32 microcontroller. The command line examples are tailored to Debian/Ubuntu environments.

### What is Covered

- Configuration instructions for the Arduino IDE to compile a sample using the [Azure SDK for Embedded C](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-c).
- Configuration, build, and run instructions for the IoT Hub telemetry sample.

_The following was run on Windows 11, with Arduino IDE 2.1.0 and ESP32 board library version 2.0.9._

## Prerequisites

- Have an [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/) created.
- Have an [Azure IoT Hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-create-through-portal) created.
- Have a logical device created in your Azure IoT Hub: using authentication type "Symmetric Key" or "X.509 self-signed".   
    - **Symmetric Key**: follow [this guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-create-through-portal#register-a-new-device-in-the-iot-hub) to create a device.In this case, the device keys are used to automatically generate a SAS token for authentication.
    - **X.509 self-signed cert**: Instructions on how to create an X.509 cert for tests can be found [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-c/blob/main/sdk/samples/iot/docs/how_to_iot_hub_samples_linux.md#configure-and-run-the-samples) (Step 1). Please note that you might need to install some of the [prerequisites](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-c/blob/main/sdk/samples/iot/docs/how_to_iot_hub_samples_linux.md#prerequisites) like OpenSSL.
- Have the latest [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) installed.

- Have the [ESP32 board support](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32) installed on Arduino IDE.

    - ESP32 boards are not natively supported by Arduino IDE, so you need to add them manually.
    - Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32) in the official ESP32 repository.
    - If your ESP32 board is not recognized and a COM port is not mapped by your computer, try installing the [serial port drivers](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/establish-serial-connection.html#connect-esp32-to-pc) recommended by ESPRESSIF.

- Have one of the following interfaces to your Azure IoT Hub set up:
  - [Azure Command Line Interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) (Azure CLI) utility installed, along with the [Azure IoT CLI extension](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-cli-extension).

    On Windows:

      Download and install: https://aka.ms/installazurecliwindows

      ```powershell
      PS C:\>az extension add --name azure-iot
      ```

    On Linux:

      ```bash
      $ curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash
      $ az extension add --name azure-iot
      ```

      A list of all the Azure IoT CLI extension commands can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/iot?view=azure-cli-latest).

  - The most recent version of [Azure IoT Explorer](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-explorer/releases) installed. More instruction on its usage can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-pnp/howto-use-iot-explorer).

  NOTE: This guide demonstrates use of the Azure CLI and does NOT demonstrate use of Azure IoT Explorer.

## Setup and Run Instructions

1. Run the Arduino IDE.

2. Install the Azure SDK for Embedded C library.

    - On the Arduino IDE, go to menu `Sketch`, `Include Library`, `Manage Libraries...`.
    - Search for and install `azure-sdk-for-c`.

3. Open the ESPRESSIF ESP32 sample.

    - On the Arduino IDE, go to menu `File`, `Examples`, `azure-sdk-for-c`.
    - Click on `az_esp32` to open the sample.

4. Configure the ESPRESSIF ESP32 sample.

    Enter your Azure IoT Hub and device information into the sample's `iot_configs.h`:
    - Add your Wi-Fi SSID to `IOT_CONFIG_WIFI_SSID`
    - Add your Wi-Fi password to `IOT_CONFIG_WIFI_PASSWORD`
    - Add you IoTHub Name to `IOT_CONFIG_IOTHUB_FQDN`
    - Add your Device ID to `IOT_CONFIG_DEVICE_ID`
    - If using **X.509 Cert**:
        - Uncomment the `#define IOT_CONFIG_USE_X509_CERT`
        - Add your cert to `IOT_CONFIG_USE_X509_CERT`
        - Add your cert PK to `IOT_CONFIG_DEVICE_CERT_PRIVATE_KEY`
    - If using **Symmetric Key**:
        - Add your device key to `IOT_CONFIG_DEVICE_KEY`

5. Connect the ESP32 microcontroller to your USB port.

6. On the Arduino IDE, select the board and port.

    - Go to menu `Tools`, `Board` and select `ESP32`.
    - Go to menu `Tools`, `Port` and select the port to which the microcontroller is connected.

7. Upload the sketch.

    - Go to menu `Sketch` and click on `Upload`.

8. Monitor the MCU (microcontroller) locally via the Serial Port.

    - Go to menu `Tools`, `Serial Monitor`.

        If you perform this step right away after uploading the sketch, the serial monitor will show an output similar to the following upon success:

        ```text
        Connecting to WIFI SSID buckaroo
        .......................WiFi connected, IP address:
        192.168.1.123
        Setting time using SNTP..............................done!
        Current time: Thu May 28 02:55:05 2020
        Client ID: mydeviceid
        Username: myiothub.azure-devices.net/mydeviceid/?api-version=2018-06-30&DeviceClientType=c%2F1.0.0

        MQTT connecting ... connected.
        ```

9. Monitor the telemetry messages sent to the Azure IoT Hub using the connection string for the policy name `iothubowner` found under "Shared access policies" on your IoT Hub in the Azure portal.

    ```bash
    $ az iot hub monitor-events --login <your Azure IoT Hub owner connection string in quotes> --device-id <your device id>
    ```

    <details><summary><i>Expected telemetry output:</i></summary>
    <p>

    ```bash
    Starting event monitor, filtering on device: mydeviceid, use ctrl-c to stop...
    {
        "event": {
            "origin": "mydeviceid",
            "payload": "payload"
        }
    }
    {
        "event": {
            "origin": "mydeviceid",
            "payload": "payload"
        }
    }
    {
        "event": {
            "origin": "mydeviceid",
            "payload": "payload"
        }
    }
    {
        "event": {
            "origin": "mydeviceid",
            "payload": "payload"
        }
    }
    {
        "event": {
            "origin": "mydeviceid",
            "payload": "payload"
        }
    }
    {
        "event": {
            "origin": "mydeviceid",
            "payload": "payload"
        }
    }
    ^CStopping event monitor...
    ```

    </p>
    </details>

## Certificates - Important to know

The Azure IoT service certificates presented during TLS negotiation shall be always validated, on the device, using the appropriate trusted root CA certificate(s).

The Azure SDK for C Arduino library automatically installs the root certificate used in the United States regions, and adds it to the Arduino sketch project when the library is included.

For other regions (and private cloud environments), please use the appropriate root CA certificate.

### Additional Information

For important information and additional guidance about certificates, please refer to [this blog post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/internet-of-things/azure-iot-tls-changes-are-coming-and-why-you-should-care/ba-p/1658456) from the security team.

## Troubleshooting

- The error policy for the Embedded C SDK client library is documented [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-c/blob/main/sdk/docs/iot/mqtt_state_machine.md#error-policy).
- File an issue via [Github Issues](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-c/issues/new/choose).
- Check [previous questions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/azure+c) or ask new ones on StackOverflow using the `azure` and `c` tags.
