## Introduction

This is a "to-the-point" guide outlining how to run an Azure SDK for Embedded C ADU sample on an ESP32 microcontroller. The command line examples are tailored to Debian/Ubuntu environments.

### What is Covered

- Configuration instructions for the Arduino IDE to compile a sample using the [Azure SDK for Embedded C](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-c).
- Setting up and configuring the necessary services for the scenario.
- Configuration, build, and run instructions for the IoT ADU sample.

_The following was run on Windows 11, with Arduino IDE 2.1.0 and ESP32 board library version 2.0.9._

## Prerequisites

- Have an [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/) created.
- Have an [Azure IoT Hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-create-through-portal) created.
  > Important: To use Azure Device Update you must have an Azure IoT Hub with [scale unit](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-scaling) S1, S2, S3 or a free/standard hub. This sample will not work with a Azure IoT Hub 'Basic' scale unit. 
- Have an [Azure Device Update](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub-device-update/create-device-update-account?tabs=portal) instance created and linked to your Azure IoT Hub.
- Have a logical device created in your Azure IoT Hub: using authentication type "Symmetric Key" or "X.509 self-signed".   
  - **Symmetric Key**: follow [this guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-create-through-portal#register-a-new-device-in-the-iot-hub) to create a device.In this case, the device keys are used to automatically generate a SAS token for authentication.
  - **X.509 self-signed cert**: Instructions on how to create an X.509 cert for tests can be found [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-c/blob/main/sdk/samples/iot/docs/how_to_iot_hub_samples_linux.md#configure-and-run-the-samples) (Step 1). Please note that you might need to install some of the [prerequisites](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-c/blob/main/sdk/samples/iot/docs/how_to_iot_hub_samples_linux.md#prerequisites) like OpenSSL.
- Have the latest [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) installed.

- Have the [ESP32 board support](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32) installed on Arduino IDE.

  - ESP32 boards are not natively supported by Arduino IDE, so you need to add them manually.
  - Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32) in the official ESP32 repository.
  - If your ESP32 board is not recognized and a COM port is not mapped by your computer, try installing the [serial port drivers](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/establish-serial-connection.html#connect-esp32-to-pc) recommended by ESPRESSIF.
- Install Azure CLI and Azure IoT Module

  See steps to install both [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub-device-update/create-update?source=recommendations#prerequisites).

## Add Azure IoT Hub Device to an ADU Deployment Group

Add the `"ADUGroup"` tag to the device's top-level twin document. This is used to group devices together, and you may choose whichever tag you prefer (e.g., "embeddedSDK").

```json
"tags": {
    "ADUGroup": "<your-tag-here>"
},
```

Viewing the device twin on the portal, the "tag" section should look similar to the following. Don't worry if you do or do not have a `"deviceUpdate"` section in the `"ADUGroup"` tag. ADU adds that as a default group.

1. Monitor the MCU (microcontroller) locally via the Serial Port.

    - Go to menu `Tools`, `Serial Monitor`.

        If you perform this step right away after uploading the sketch, the serial monitor will show an output similar to the following upon success:

        ```text

        ```


## New Image Instructions

In order to update our device, we have to build the image which our device will update to. We will have to direct the Arduino IDE to specify an output directory so that we can easily find the binary. Open the `preferences.txt` (find its path going to menu `File`, `Preferences`) and add `build.path=C:\Arduino-output` (or whichever directory you prefer), then restart the Arduino IDE.

Once you are done with the ADU sample, you may remove the added configuration to restore the build output to its original location.

1. Update the image version in the sketch configuration

    - In `iot_configs.h`, change the `ADU_DEVICE_VERSION` to version 1.1.

1. Click on "Verify" to build the update image.

    Once the build is complete, you should then have a file called `Azure_IoT_Adu_ESP32.ino.bin` in your output directory. Copy that file to a new directory `C:\ADU-update`, and rename it `Azure_IoT_Adu_ESP32_1.1.bin`

### Generate the ADU Update Manifest

Open PowerShell.

Navigate to the `C:\ADU-update` directory.

Run the following command:

```powershell
az iot du update init v5 --update-provider Contoso --update-name ESP32-Embedded --update-version 1.1 --compat deviceModel=ESP32-Embedded deviceManufacturer=ESPRESSIF --step handler=microsoft/swupdate:1 properties='{\"installedCriteria\":\"1.1\"}' --file path=./Azure_IoT_Adu_ESP32_1.1.bin > ./Contoso.ESP32-Embedded.1.1.importmanifest.json
```

Verify you have the following files in your ADU-update directory:

- `Azure_IoT_Adu_ESP32_1.1.bin`
- `Contoso.ESP32-Embedded.1.1.importmanifest.json`

### Import the Update Manifest

To import the update (`Azure_IoT_Adu_ESP32_1.1.bin`) and manifest (`Contoso.ESP32-Embedded.1.1.importmanifest.json`), follow the instructions at the link below:

- [Import Update and Manifest](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub-device-update/import-update)


### Deploy Update

To deploy the update to your ESP32, follow the link below:

- [Deploy Update](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub-device-update/deploy-update)

### Monitor the Update Process

  In Arduino IDE, go to menu `Tools`, `Serial Monitor`.

  Once the update request is received by the device, a log similar to this should be displayed:

  ```text
  2022/11/3 05:25:32 [INFO] Client received a properties topic.
  2022/11/3 05:25:32 [INFO] Status: 200
  2022/11/3 05:25:32 [INFO] Message Type: Desired Properties
  2022/11/3 05:25:32 [INFO] Parsed Azure device update manifest.
  2022/11/3 05:25:32 [INFO] [JWS] Calculated manifest SHA matches parsed SHA
  2022/11/3 05:25:32 [INFO] Manifest authenticated successfully
  2022/11/3 05:25:32 [INFO] Sending manifest property accept
  ...
  ```

  And once the update is complete (including the device automatic reboot), the new version should be printed:

  ```text
  2022/11/3 05:26:22 [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  2022/11/3 05:26:22 [INFO] ADU SAMPLE
  2022/11/3 05:26:22 [INFO] Version: 1.1
  2022/11/3 05:26:22 [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ```

## Certificates - Important to know

The Azure IoT service certificates presented during TLS negotiation shall be always validated, on the device, using the appropriate trusted root CA certificate(s).

The Azure SDK for C Arduino library automatically installs the root certificate used in the United States regions, and adds it to the Arduino sketch project when the library is included.

For other regions (and private cloud environments), please use the appropriate root CA certificate.

### Additional Information

For important information and additional guidance about certificates, please refer to [this blog post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/internet-of-things/azure-iot-tls-changes-are-coming-and-why-you-should-care/ba-p/1658456) from the security team.
